# Pizza_sales_Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data to gain insights into sales trends, revenue distribution, and customer preferences based on pizza categories, order times, and pizza size. The analysis involves data cleaning, handling missing values, addressing outliers, and visualizing key metrics using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for missing values in the `order_id` columns to maintain data integrity.

2. **Outlier Handling**  
   - Checked for extreme outliers in the `total_price` column using median values to avoid skewed results.

3. **Key Metrics Analysis**  
   - Analyzed sales trends based on pizza category, size, and types(vegetarian or non-vegetarian).

   - Explored revenue distribution by creating sales intervals and comparing sales performance across different time periods.

4. KPI Analysis & Visualization

   - Utilized Power BI for dynamic KPI dashboards.

   - Created Excel-based pivot tables and charts for additional insights.
